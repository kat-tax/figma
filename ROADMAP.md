# ROADMAP

## Style Libraries
- [x] Unistyles (default)
- [ ] Tamagui (planned...)
- [ ] GlueStack (planned...)
- [ ] NativeWind (maybe...)

## Planned Features
- [ ] Interactions: (accessibility, pressablility, textinput, etc.)
- [ ] Screens: (navigation based on prototype settings)
- [ ] Show console log in preview (https://github.com/storybookjs/react-inspector)

## Planned Tools
- [ ] Doctor (fix structure, autolayout, etc.)
- [ ] Auto Shimmer (auto create shimmer variant)
- [ ] Import Redux Store
- [ ] Import Primitives
- [ ] Import Icons
- [ ] Import Theme

## Optimization Goals
- Replace ESBuild with SWC? (https://swc.rs/docs/usage/wasm)
- Diff Monaco text instead of fully replacing (and highlight changes)
